## 📈 Features
✔️ Sales trends by region and country. <br>
✔️ Revenue distribution across different segments. <br>
✔️ Visual insights into key performance indicators (KPIs). <br>

## 🔍 Usage
This dashboard can be used for:
- Business analysis & reporting.
- Identifying high-performing regions.
- Understanding revenue trends.

## 📌 Notes
- I gave Regions a Geographic Role as Country/Region.
- I renamed these 2 Columns: Total Revenue -> Sales & Total Profit -> Profit.
- I used a Data Source Filter to get only data from 2012 and optimise performance.
- For interactivity purposes, I've also added filters to these 3 sheets on the dashboard: Sales by Month, Sales by Type & Sales by Country. Which means selecting for example a particular month or Item Type or Country changes both Sales and Profit values as well as the other sheets values accordingly.

- - Assigned a *Geographic Role* to the *Regions* field as *Country/Region*.  
- Renamed columns:  
  - `Total Revenue` → `Sales`  
  - `Total Profit` → `Profit`  
- Applied a *Data Source Filter* to include only 2012 data for optimized performance.  
- Added filters for *Sales by Month, Sales by Type,* and *Sales by Country* to enhance interactivity.  
  - Selecting a specific *month*, *item type*, or *country* dynamically updates the *Sales* and *Profit* values, along with the other sheets in the dashboard.
